SDL Readme File

Notes: 

-This program is a basic game designed to be like Frogger that has been built with C and SDL libraries.

-Work is split between the "main.c" and "game.c" files, which can all be found in the "game" folder; they can be opened and viewed in any text editor.

-The other file needed to run this program is the "game.h" file, however the makefile will automatically handle this file in the compilation process as long as they are in the same folder.

-The fonts folder contains a font type used in the program.

Instructions:

-In order to run the file it must first be complied, which is done with the makefile. To do this on Linux, go to the directory containing the "makefile", "main.c", "game.c" and "WordList.h" files, then enter the following command into the terminal:
	./make
The compilation is successful if it reports that the makefile is up to date or it has been complied, and therefore updated.

-Then execute the file with the following command:
	./game

-Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to control the red square.

-To exit the game press "ESC" on the keyboard or click the "X" icon in the window.
